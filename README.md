# Simultaneous isolation of proximal and distal lung progenitor cells from individual mice using a 3D printed guide reduces proximal cell contamination of distal lung epithelial cell isolations

This repository includes several of the resources related to the manuscript: Simultaneous isolation of proximal and distal lung progenitor cells from individual mice using a 3D printed guide reduces proximal cell contamination of distal lung epithelial cell isolations.


The manuscript is available on BioRxiv: https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.05.10.491312

Folder **3DLD_design** contains stl files to print the guide for mouse lungs. 
Folder **Figure_codes** contains all R codes needed to produce the figures.

The RNAseq data is deposited on the EMBL-EBI: https://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress/experiments/E-MTAB-11502/

Alignment of RNAseq was done using Star align and counts were obtained using featureCounts.
